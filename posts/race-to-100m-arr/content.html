<p>So, it turns out there is actually no meaningful correlation between how quickly a generational startup gets to $100M in ARR and the magnitude of its eventual success.</p>

<p>Decided to pull this data because every time you turn a corner in SF, there is another VC debating whether the "triple-triple-double-double-double" paradigm is dead because a handful of ripping AI startups are sucking the air out the room for everyone else. That would suggest that nuking to $100M overnight is the only way to win.</p>

<p>But if the past is any indicator, that's probably… not true.</p>

<p>There have always been companies that blow traditional growth benchmarks out of the water and ones that grow more steadily over time. (We've all seen the "Fastest to $100M" charts). But when you actually compare that speed to the size of eventual outcomes, there is really no correlation. In fact, if you look at the value of these companies at their respective peaks, there is actually a slightly inverse relationship between speed and success.</p>

<h2>Takeaways</h2>

<p><strong>(1) $100M is a milestone (albeit an important one), but it's not the final destination.</strong> We are talking about truly generational companies. At that level of scale, the real north star looks more like ten billion than hundreds of millions, and in case you forgot, $100M is just 1% of $10B.</p>

<p><strong>(2) Speed is not the only playbook.</strong> Time to $100M isn't destiny, and some of the biggest outcomes took longer to get there while others around them grew faster.</p>

<p>To be abundantly clear, getting to $100M that quickly is an extremely impressive feat and indicative of companies building incredible products. That should not be discounted, and we will 100% continue to look for these kinds of investments. Too far in the other extreme is also true (limping to $100M with decelerating growth is probably not… great). But none of that detracts from the fact that it is a long road to success in this industry. There are many ways up the mountain, and it takes time to build something enduring!</p>
