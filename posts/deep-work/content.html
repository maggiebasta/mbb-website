<p>Deep work is the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task. It's a skill that's increasingly rare and therefore increasingly valuable in our distraction-filled world.</p>

<h2>The Cost of Context Switching</h2>
<p>Every time you switch tasks, there's a cognitive cost. Your brain doesn't instantly transition—it leaves "attention residue" behind. This residue makes it harder to focus on the new task and reduces your cognitive performance.</p>

<p>Research shows that it can take 23 minutes to fully refocus after a distraction. Yet most knowledge workers check their email or messages every 6 minutes. The math doesn't add up.</p>

<h2>Building a Deep Work Practice</h2>
<p>Here's what's worked for me:</p>

<h3>1. Schedule Deep Work Sessions</h3>
<p>Block out specific times for deep work. Treat these blocks as sacred—no meetings, no email, no exceptions. Start with 90-minute sessions and build from there.</p>

<h3>2. Create Rituals</h3>
<p>Develop a routine that signals to your brain it's time to focus. This might be:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Making a specific type of coffee</li>
    <li>Putting on focus music</li>
    <li>Moving to a specific location</li>
    <li>Doing a brief meditation</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Eliminate Digital Distractions</h3>
<p>Use tools to block distracting websites. Put your phone in another room. Close unnecessary browser tabs. The goal is to make distraction difficult enough that you can overcome the impulse.</p>

<h2>The Compound Effect</h2>
<p>The magic of deep work isn't in any single session—it's in the compound effect of consistent, focused effort over time. Small improvements compound into extraordinary results.</p>

<p>Your ability to do deep work will determine your ability to create work that matters. It's worth the effort to protect and cultivate this skill.</p>
