<p>The prototypical AI founder doesn't really exist.</p>

<p>If you try to pattern match any sort of on-paper or easily quantifiable founder trait with recent AI startup success, the results are all over the place.</p>

<p>It's widely acknowledged that generational founders are often inherently idiosyncratic. But still, the valley is weird and a bit paradoxical. Even though the whole point is to find the n-of-1 founder, investors also crave the comfort of pattern matching. And these days, it seems like popular imagination has converged on the idea that moving fast and competing in the talent wars of the AI era does necessitate a very specific founder profile—young (sometimes shockingly so), well connected, and an on paper pedigree that signals early signs of technical genius.</p>

<p>But when you actually look at the founder profiles behind the explosive AI unicorns of the past 3 years, any clear pattern falls apart. There are some small spikes. E.g., nearly 1 in 4 of these founders has a PhD in a technical domain, and there has been an impressive amount of talent that has come out of MIT. But what's more striking is the size of the long tail.</p>

<p>The other way to look at it is that over 75% of these founders don't have a PhD. Many are immigrants from very different parts of the world. Their ages vary dramatically. The undergrad institutions they represent span a wide range (the majority of which are not in any sort of "top 10" list). Even the spread of first lead investors is all over the map.</p>

<p>Which brings us back to our very predictable starting place. AI hasn't changed the fact that this is still an n-of-1 game. That doesn't mean that identifying n-of-1 is a fool's errand (if it did, I'd probably need a new job). But it does mean the answer is a bit more complicated than settling on a surface level archetype.</p>
