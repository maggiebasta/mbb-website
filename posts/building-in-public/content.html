<p>There's something liberating about building in public. It's the act of sharing your progress, your failures, and your learnings as they happen—not after you've achieved some arbitrary milestone of "success."</p>

<h2>Why It Matters</h2>
<p>When you build in public, you create accountability. You transform abstract ideas into concrete commitments. The simple act of sharing what you're working on makes it real in a way that private projects never quite achieve.</p>

<p>But more importantly, you create connections. People resonate with the journey, not just the destination. They want to see the messy middle, the pivots, the moments of doubt.</p>

<h2>The Unexpected Benefits</h2>
<p>I've found that building in public leads to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Serendipitous connections with like-minded builders</li>
    <li>Feedback that saves you months of wasted effort</li>
    <li>A documented journey you can look back on</li>
    <li>Opportunities you never could have predicted</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>"The best time to start was yesterday. The second best time is now."</blockquote>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>You don't need a massive audience or a perfect platform. Start small:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Share one thing you learned today</li>
    <li>Post a screenshot of what you're building</li>
    <li>Write about a problem you're trying to solve</li>
</ul>

<p>The magic isn't in the size of your audience—it's in the consistency of showing up and the authenticity of your voice.</p>
